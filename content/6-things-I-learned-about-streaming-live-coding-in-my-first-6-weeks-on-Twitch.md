I discovered live coding serendipitously on Twitch for the first time in mid June 2020. I was
instantly hooked on the huge sense of community, the opportunities to learn, and the way in which
the platform increases accessibility and engagement in science and technology content across the
world.

I'm still not entirely sure why people choose to watch my content, but what I am sure of, is that
the more we can grow and engage with the science and technology community through streaming a
variety of content, the more people we can empower through tech to grow their own futures in this
ever-evolving world.

For anyone who's thinking about getting started with streaming live coding, I've put together six
valuable lessons I learned in my first six weeks on Twitch to hopefully make you a little bit less
hesitant about pressing that go-live button.

## You don't need a pro set up to get started

There's no need to invest in expensive kit when you're just starting out. In fact, I would highly
recommend that you buy absolutely nothing in preparation for your first few streams - because you
don't really know what you're going to need until your content starts evolving.

All you really need to get started is a laptop with an in-built microphone and webcam (if you want
to show your face), some streaming software such as OBS (available for free), and something to do on
your stream. That's it! Anything else is overkill and will certainly give you a lot more to worry
about as you press the go-live button.

> More kit definitely means more problems, so start slow, and adapt as you go.

Once you've found your rhythm and developed your style, and your community is starting to grow, then
is the time to figure out how to increase the production value of your stream - whatever that may
mean for you.

## You will have tech issues!

//stressful - but take advice //quality production increases engagement //but you are the most
important thing about your stream

## Stream the content that motivates you

try stuff but if it doesn't work out, move on //I thought I had to do whatever everyone else was
doing to 'fit in'

##Â Engage with your community through your stream and others chat is key get some good mods

## Let your stream evolve organically

Style, overlays, audience interaction

## The most valuable element to your stream is you

## Thanks ....
