I discovered live coding serendipitously on Twitch for the first time in mid June 2020. I was
instantly hooked on the huge sense of community, the opportunities to learn, and the way in which
the platform increases accessibility and engagement in science and technology content across the
world.

> I hesitantly pressed the go-live button for the very first time around a week and a half later on

I'm still not entirely sure why people choose to watch my content, but what I am sure of, is that
the more we can grow and engage with the science and technology community through streaming a
variety of content, the more people we can empower through tech to grow their own futures in this
ever-evolving world.

For anyone who's thinking about getting started with streaming live coding, I've put together six
valuable lessons I learned in my first six weeks on Twitch to hopefully make you a little bit less
hesitant about pressing that go-live button.

## 1. You don't need a pro set up to get started

There's no need to invest in expensive kit when you're just starting out. In fact, I would highly
recommend that you buy absolutely nothing in preparation for your first few streams - because you
don't really know what you're going to need until your content starts evolving.

All you really need to get started is a laptop with an in-built microphone and webcam (if you want
to show your face), some streaming software such as OBS (available for free), and something to do on
your stream. **That's it!** Anything else is overkill and will certainly give you a lot more to
worry about as you press the go-live button.

> More kit definitely means more problems, so start slow, and adapt as you go.

Once you've found your rhythm and developed your style, and your community is starting to grow, then
is the time to figure out how to increase the production value of your stream - _whatever that may
mean for you._

## 2. You will have tech issues!

When the time comes for you to work on the production quality of your stream - you will, no doubt,
have technical issues. **Dropped frames, audio out of sync with the webcam image, 'Minecraft style
resolution' (yes, that was an exact quote from a viewer), white balance issues, flickering webcam
image and lack of CPU** - these are just _some_ of the issues I've faced as I started to evolve my
setup.

> Viewers will point out your technical issues - and this feedback is a gift.

Viewers **will** point out your technical issues - and whilst this can seem stressful whilst you're
trying to stay on top of your content and engage with the chat - this feedback is a gift - and it
shows that your viewers are engaged and want to see you succeed.

If you're unable to attempt to tweak those issues as they happen, experiment with different settings
and approaches to solving your problems off-stream, and _always crowdsource advice._

_Here are some of the key things I've learned about the optimum technical setup:_

### 1. To minimise your change of dropped frames, do not stream using WiFi

If you can't deal with a 50m long ethernet cable trailing up/down your stairs, try a powerline
adaptor.

### 2. If your programming is CPU-intensive, try a dual machine setup

I know this isn't the most cost-effective solution, but I was lucky to have a PC sitting idly below
my desk (thanks, husband for your PC-building hobby!). I now use a PC to run OBS and stream via
powerline, whilst I code on my Macbook that is connected to the PC via a capture card.

### 3. If your shiny new camera flickers randomly, use default Windows drivers and USB 2.0

I recently switched to using a Logitech Streamcam for the 60FPS and 1080p resolution, but I had
nightmare after nightmare trying to work out why the camera was flickering every now and then. After
focussing on the software settings, trying _everything_ and almost rage quitting streaming, I found
the solution was hardware-based. I switched to using Windows default drivers rather than the
Logitech drivers and buying an adaptor to plug the proprietry USB C connector into USB 2.0. And my
problem was solved!

(This might have been a unique problem to me due to the first generation USB C hardware on the
motherboard in the PC, but if I can help at least one other person with this advice, then it's
definitely worth mentioning!)

_Stay tuned for a blog post that talks about my streaming setup in detail!_

## 3. Stream the content that motivates you

We all get imposter syndrome, and to this day I still worry whether people will be interested in
what I want to stream. But take it from me, if you try and stream content that doesn't motivate you,
or content that you're not passionate about and invested in, you won't enjoy it half as much.



## 4. Engage with your community

through your stream and others chat is key

get some good mods

## 5. Let your stream evolve organically

Style, overlays, audience interaction

## 6. The most valuable element to your stream is you
